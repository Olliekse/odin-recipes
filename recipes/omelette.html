<h2>Description</h2>
<p>An omelette is a dish made from beaten eggs cooked with various fillings such as cheese, vegetables, and/or meat.</p>
<p>The eggs are whisked together and poured into a hot pan, where they are cooked until set and then folded over to
  encase the fillings. Omelettes are typically served for breakfast or brunch and can be enjoyed hot or cold.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Eggs</li>
  <li>Butter</li>
  <li>Salt</li>
  <li>Pepper</li>
  <li>Cheese</li>
  <li>Onions</li>
  <li>Tomatoes</li>
  <li>Basil</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Crack eggs into a bowl and beat them until the whites and yolks are fully mixed.</li>
  <li>Heat a non-stick skillet over medium heat and add a small amount of oil or butter.</li>
  <li>Once the oil or butter is hot, pour the beaten eggs into the skillet and let them cook for about 30 seconds.</li>
  <li>Use a spatula to gently lift the edges of the omelette, allowing the uncooked egg on top to flow underneath.</li>
  <li>Add any fillings youâ€™d like to the center of the omelette (such as cheese, vegetables, or cooked meat).</li>
  <li>Use the spatula to fold one side of the omelette over the filling, then fold the other side over the top, creating
    a half-moon shape.</li>
  <li>Cook the omelette for an additional 1-2 minutes, or until the egg is fully cooked and the cheese (if using) is
    melted.</li>
  <li>Use the spatula to carefully transfer the omelette to a plate, and serve hot.</li>
